# Puppeteer Explorations

## Exploring Node.js's Puppeteer package and its use cases

This is for doing general experiments with Puppeteer in a Docker environment.

This is NOT production-ready code! It's meant to serve as a thin baseline for local experimentation.

To run locally, `docker-compose up --build` should suffice

Tested on Windows 10 via Docker, and should work on Mac and Linux just as well
